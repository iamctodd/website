        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            With over 15 years in product and design, I've learned that great products come from asking the right questions, understanding what matters to users, and having the courage to challenge assumptions. I started as a scientist, became an engineer, moved into product management and design, and now spend my time helping teams think more strategically about their work.
        </p>
        <p>
            My approach is grounded in data and research, but filtered through design thinking and a belief that the best solutions come when you involve your team in the problem-solving process. I'm equally comfortable diving into spreadsheets, facilitating design workshops, or writing about how product leaders can make better decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I'm not working on product challenges, I'm teaching at MICA and IE Business School, writing on my Substack about interruption and focus, or consulting with companies like Spotify, TripAdvisor, and The New York Times on product strategy.
